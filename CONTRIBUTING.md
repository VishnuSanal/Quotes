# Contribution Guide

    Hey there! Happy to see you here :) Read up!

- ## Please Note

- Never start working on an issue until it's not assigned to you!
- Please rearrange the code with Andorid Studio (`Ctrl + Alt + L` or `Cmd + Alt + L`) before making a PR
- Creation of a new branch for every contribution is recommended
- Feel free to create issues too. That too counts as a contribution!
- Feel free to join our [community](https://discord.gg/M8ukyzTP5G) if you face any issue or need help on the project

**Note**: If you're a user of Quotes Status Creator, copying all the contents from `Documents/Quotes` to `Documents/Quotes - Debug` will save some data by not needing to download those assets again!

- ## Recommended WorkFlow

    ```
    Check the issue section -> Choose an issue that you can fix ->
    Comment there asking to work on the issue -> Start working on the issue when it gets assigned to you
    ```
